# mdia3126-week-6

If u already start a bit, u can just copy what u need.

If u are in mental hell, you can do the following:

Get into ur course folder to clone my repo.

After u clone it, get into web -- `cd web`, then `npm install`.
Then `cd ..` , back to week 6 file, then get into mob -- `cd mob`, then `npm install`.

To run web ver, you go `npm run dev`.
To run mob ver, you go `npm start` or `expo start`.

If u have problem just let me know.
